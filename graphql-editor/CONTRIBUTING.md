# Contributing to GraphQL Editor

We welcome contributions to GraphQL Editor of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.

_Changes to the codebase **and** related documentation, e.g. for a new feature, should still use a single pull request._

## Asking Support Questions

We have an [discussion forum](https://spectrum.chat/graphql-editor) where users and developers can ask questions.
Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions.

## Reporting Issues

If you believe you have found a defect in GraphQL Editor or its documentation, use
the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/slothking-online/graphql-editor/issues) to report
the problem to the maintainers. If you're not sure if it's a bug or not,
start by asking in the [discussion forum](https://spectrum.chat/graphql-editor).

## Code Contribution

GraphQL Editor is still looking for its direction so remember functionality has to:

- repair existing bugs
- introduce new feature requests

**Bug fixes are, of course, always welcome.**

## Submitting Patches

If you are interested in helping with the project, we will help you with your contribution. GraphQL Editor is a little bit complicated project touching many technologies feel free to ask us for help on [discussion forum](https://spectrum.chat/graphql-editor) or [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/graphqleditor/shared_invite/enQtNDkwOTgyOTM5OTc1LWI4YjU3N2U5NGVkNzQ2NzY5MGUxMTJiNjFlZDM1Zjc2OWRmNTI0NDM3OWUxYTk4Yjk3MzZlY2QwOWUzZmM2NDI)

### Code Contribution Guidelines

Because we want to create the best possible product for our users and the best contribution experience for our developers, we have a set of guidelines which ensure that all contributions are acceptable. The guidelines are not intended as a filter or barrier to participation. If you are unfamiliar with the contribution process, our team will help you and teach you how to bring your contribution in accordance with the guidelines.

To make the contribution process as seamless as possible, we ask for the following:

- Go ahead and fork the project and make your changes. We encourage pull requests to allow for review and discussion of code changes.
- When you’re ready to create a pull request, be sure to:
  - Add documentation if you are adding new features or changing functionality. The docs site lives in `/docs`.
  - Squash your commits into a single commit. `git rebase -i`. It’s okay to force update your pull request with `git push -f`.
